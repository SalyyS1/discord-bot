**Parent**: [roadmap.md](file:///D:/Project/.2_PROJECT_BOT_DISCORD/plans/2026-01-sylabot-roadmap/roadmap.md)

## Goal

Build infrastructure for sustainable growth: documentation, analytics, monetization.

## Prerequisites

✅ Stage 1: Stability  
✅ Stage 2: Usability  
✅ Stage 3: Clarity

## Phases

| # | Phase | Effort | Status |
|---|-------|--------|--------|
| 4.1 | [Documentation Site](file:///D:/Project/.2_PROJECT_BOT_DISCORD/plans/2026-01-sylabot-roadmap/stage-4-growth/phase-01-docs.md) | 6h | ⬜ |
| 4.2 | [Analytics](file:///D:/Project/.2_PROJECT_BOT_DISCORD/plans/2026-01-sylabot-roadmap/stage-4-growth/phase-02-analytics.md) | 4h | ⬜ |
| 4.3 | [Monetization](file:///D:/Project/.2_PROJECT_BOT_DISCORD/plans/2026-01-sylabot-roadmap/stage-4-growth/phase-03-monetization.md) | 6h+ | ⬜ |

## Explicit Non-Goals

- ❌ New bot features
- ❌ Multi-language support
- ❌ Mobile app
- ❌ API for third parties

## Key Components

### Documentation
- Docusaurus/Nextra site

- Feature adoption tracking
- Error monitoring (Sentry)
- Performance metrics

### Monetization (if applicable)

## Success Criteria

1. Support questions reduced by 50%+ (self-service docs)
2. Usage visibility for decision making
3. Revenue infrastructure ready (if applicable)
4. Community engagement mechanisms

## Long-term Roadmap Ideas

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Plugin system | Low | Allow community extensions |
| API access | Low | For power users |
| White-label | Very Low | Enterprise feature |
| Multi-language | Medium | i18n support |
