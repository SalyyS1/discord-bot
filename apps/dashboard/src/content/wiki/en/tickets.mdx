# Ticket System

Provide efficient member support with SylaBot's ticket system.

## Overview

The ticket system allows members to create private support channels where they can get help from your moderation team.

## Initial Setup

### Step 1: Create Ticket Category

1. In Discord, create a new category named **"Tickets"** or similar
2. Right-click the category → **Copy ID**
3. Paste the ID in dashboard settings

### Step 2: Configure Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Dashboard** → **Tickets**
2. Paste **Ticket Category ID**
3. Configure ticket settings:
   - Maximum open tickets per user
   - Support role mentions
   - Auto-close timer

### Step 3: Create Ticket Panel

Use the bot command to create a ticket panel:

```
/ticket-panel create
```

Configure the panel message and reaction emoji.

## How Members Create Tickets

Members can create tickets in two ways:

1. **React to Panel** - Click the 📩 reaction on the ticket panel
2. **Use Command** - Type `/ticket create [reason]`

## Ticket Workflow

### When a Ticket is Created

1. Private channel created in ticket category
2. Member and support staff get access
3. Notification sent to support role
4. Ticket logged in dashboard

### Managing Tickets

**Add Members**:
```
/ticket add @user
```

**Remove Members**:
```
/ticket remove @user
```

**Close Ticket**:
```
/ticket close [reason]
```

```
/ticket claim
```

## Dashboard Management

### Open Tickets

- See all currently open tickets
