1. In Discord, create a category for temp channels (e.g., "Voice Rooms")
2. Right-click category → **Copy ID**

### Step 2: Create Join Channel

1. Create a voice channel named "➕ Join to Create" (or similar)
2. Place it in the category
3. Right-click channel → **Copy ID**
4. Save the channel ID

### Step 3: Configure Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Dashboard** → **Temp Voice**
2. Enter **Creator Channel ID** (join channel)
3. Enter **Category ID** (where new channels spawn)
4. Configure default settings
5. Save changes

## Configuration Options

```

### Default User Limit

Set default member limit for new channels:

```

```

Members can change this after creating their channel.

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Naming** - Make join channel obvious ("Join to Create")
2. **Organized Category** - Keep temp channels in dedicated category
3. **Reasonable Limits** - Default 4-10 member limit prevents abuse
4. **Quick Deletion** - Short empty timer (5-10 seconds) keeps category clean
5. **User Education** - Explain temp voice in welcome/rules channel

## Troubleshooting

**Channels Not Creating**: Check bot permissions (Manage Channels, Move Members).

**Can't Delete Channels**: Ensure bot has Manage Channels permission.

**Members Can't Join**: Check if channel is locked or user is blacklisted.

**Duplicate Channels**: Verify only one join channel is configured.
