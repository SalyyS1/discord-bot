# Moderation

Keep your Discord server safe with SylaBot's powerful auto-moderation features.

## Overview

The moderation system helps you automatically detect and handle rule violations, spam, and unwanted content without manual intervention.

## Anti-Spam Protection

Prevent spam messages from flooding your server.

### How It Works

The anti-spam system monitors message frequency and automatically takes action when users exceed the configured threshold.

### Configuration

1. Navigate to **Dashboard** → **Moderation**
2. Enable **Anti-Spam** toggle
3. Configure these settings:
   - **Message Threshold** - Number of messages (default: 5)
   - **Time Window** - Time period in milliseconds (default: 5000ms)

### Example Configuration

```
Message Threshold: 5
Time Window: 5000ms
```

This means if a user sends 5 messages within 5 seconds, the anti-spam will trigger.

### Actions Taken

When anti-spam triggers:
- Message deletion
- Temporary mute (configurable duration)
- Warning logged to audit log
- Notification to moderators (optional)

## Anti-Link Protection

Control link sharing in your server channels.

### Features

- Detect and remove unauthorized links
- Whitelist trusted domains
- Exempt specific roles (like moderators)

### Setup

1. Go to **Moderation** settings
2. Enable **Anti-Link** toggle
3. Configure allowed domains (optional)
4. Set exempt roles

### Whitelist Domains

Add trusted domains to allow:
```
youtube.com
discord.gg
your-website.com
```

## Warnings System

Track member violations and take progressive action.

### Warning Thresholds

Configure automatic actions based on warning count:

- **3 Warnings** - 24-hour timeout
- **5 Warnings** - 7-day timeout
- **10 Warnings** - Kick from server

## Moderation Logs

All moderation actions are logged in the audit system:

- View in **Dashboard** → **Audit**
- Filter by action type
- Export logs for review

## Best Practices

1. **Start Lenient** - Begin with higher thresholds and adjust based on server activity
2. **Exempt Trusted Roles** - Don't apply strict rules to moderators and trusted members
3. **Monitor Logs** - Regularly review moderation actions to fine-tune settings
4. **Communicate Rules** - Make sure members know the server rules

## Advanced Settings

### Custom Filter Words

Add custom words or phrases to auto-moderate:

1. Go to **Auto Responder** settings
2. Create trigger for filtered words
3. Set action to delete message

### Role-Based Exemptions

Exclude specific roles from moderation:
- Moderator roles
- VIP members
- Trusted contributors

## Troubleshooting

**False Positives**: If legitimate messages are being flagged, increase thresholds or add exemptions.

**Not Working**: Ensure SylaBot has proper permissions (Manage Messages, Timeout Members).
